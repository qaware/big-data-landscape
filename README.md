# Big Data Landscape
The Big Data Landscape provides a detailed overview over the most relevant Big Data technologies, most of them open source. 

With the Big Data universe developing very fast, the Big Data Landscape has to be updated regularily. In this repo you can find all versions of the Big Data Landscape from the very beginning (2016) until now. The latest version is shown below.
